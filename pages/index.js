                    <p>
                        Hello my name's Yasiru, people call me Yas. I'm from
                        Colombo, Sri Lanka. I'm 17 years old and I am currently
                        a student at Trinity College Kandy. I enjoy programming
                        and almost anything related to computers. How computers
                        function really amazed me and here I am digging deeper
                        into the field and building my career doing what I love.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Taking apart things and breaking them, making something
                        different, and fiddling around with circuits, this was
                        my thing. I got my hands on my dad's laptop and I ruined
                        it trying to do things I didn't know. I got my own
                        computer in grade 9 where I wrote my first ever
                        "program", it was a windows batch file game that worked
                        on the terminal. I was in boarding school so I didn't
                        have much time to do things with my computer, the only
                        time I get to use my computer was on weekends when I got
                        home. <br />
                        <br />
                        When Covid started things changed, lockdown is what
                        really got me going. I met a lot of people online, one
                        of them was a developer that encouraged me to learn
                        JavaScript. I wanted to build a discord bot and that was
                        when I programmed something with an actual programming
                        language. Since then I've been learning and building
                        various things like chatbots, websites, automation
                        programs, and web scrappers.

                                Discord is a goood platform for any sort of
                                community, and discord bots can pretty much do
                                anything on the platform. I can get anything
                                working from a bot that can do simple day to day
                                tasks on discord, chat moderation or pretty much
                                any task as long as the platform supports it.
