                <p>
                    I'm 16 years old, still in high school studying for GCE AL's in 2023 mathematics stream, in <a href="https://www.trinitycollege.lk" target="_blank" >Trinity College Kandy</a> <i>~ Respice Finem</i>.
                    Got into programming when the pandemic lockdown began in 2020 April,
                    when a dev who intoduced me to to javascript who later suggested me to learn python and javascript.
                    Since then I've been coding a lot in both the languages.
                    Met <a href="https://github.com/LeoSko" target="_blank" >LeoSko</a> who gave me good advice and an opportunity on to my first ever mass scale project.
                    I plan to become a full stack dev one day.
