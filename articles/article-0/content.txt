<h3>What is a token?</h3>
<p>
    When you log into Discord your credentials are used to obtain a token,
    it is stored in your storage locally as cache.
    Why? Because entering your credentials every time you login is not that convenient.
    Applications work with requests and responses from servers and clients,
    similarly for a server to identify you as the user you are Discord attaches your token
    to every request your Discord client makes to a server.
    Since this token is the identification used to recognize a user,
    anyone with your token can use Discord as if it was you.

<h3>Where is the token stored?</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned before your token is simply stored as browser cache, accessing it is not difficult.
    You can get your token by your self using the built in debug tools for your browser.
    There you can observe how all sorts of data is stored as cache.

<h3>Risks?</h3>
<p>
    A token is obtained after a user enters their credentials, a token is simply "the top most prioritized" authentication.
    Anyone using your token to login does not get prompted to re-enter credentials or to confirm two factor authentication.

    There is no risk if you don't run software given to you by another person or an untrusted/malicious source.
    As of the token grabbing malicious software is spread as "nitro generators", claiming that "it would generate a nitro gift code".
    These kind of software will go through your browser cache and extract your discord token, then it will send the token to the man behind the scene.
    He/she will simply login to your account and destroy everything you have, abuse your permissions in servers or if you have any billing info entered
    buy nitro with your billing details.

    Cached data by third party browsers is simply accessible to any process running on your windows computer. It does not require administrator privileges or whatsoever.
    How ever when it comes to the Edge browser, Microsoft Defender prevents other processes from meddling with your cached data. In conclusion Edge is much safer.
