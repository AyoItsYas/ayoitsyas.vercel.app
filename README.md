    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm 16 years old studying in high school for 2023 GCE AL's <a href="https://www.trinitycollege.lk" target="_blank">Trinity College Kandy</a> <i>~ Respice Finem</i>.
        Got into programming when the pandemic lockdown began in 2020 April, when a dev introduced javascript, who later suggested learning python and javascript.
        Since then I've been coding a lot in both languages. Met <a href="https://github.com/LeoSko" target="_blank">LeoSko</a> who gave me good advice and an opportunity on to my first ever mass scale project. I plan to become a full-stack dev one day.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
        These are my skills, what I'm good and bad at. I code regularly gaining experience and sharpening my skills so this is work in progress.

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the projects I handled/contributed are not open source as the owner/me of the project is not comfortable with sharing the source code.
        There are few projects where the work result is visible. I'm looking forward to contributing to more projects and fill this table up.
