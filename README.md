    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm 16 years old, still in high school studying for 2023 GCE AL's in mathematics stream,
        in <a href="https://www.trinitycollege.lk" target="_blank">Trinity College Kandy</a> <i>~ Respice Finem</i>.
        Got into programming when the pandemic lockdown began in 2020 April,
        when a dev who intoduced me to to javascript who later suggested me to learn python and javascript.
        Since then I've been coding a lot in both the languages.
        Met <a href="https://github.com/LeoSko" target="_blank">LeoSko</a> who gave me good advice and an opportunity on to my first ever mass scale project.
        I plan to become a full stack dev one day.
    </p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the projects i handled/contributed are not open source as the owner/me of the project is not comfortable with sharing the source code.
        There are few projects where the work result is visible. Looking forward to contribute to more projects and fill this table up.
