   About me
  </h3>
  <p>
    I'm still in high school studying for GCE AL's in 2023 mathematics stream. Got into programming when the pandemic lockdown began in 2020 April.
    Got into discord, met a dev who intoduced me to to javascript but suggested me to learn python. 
    Met <a href="https://github.com/LeoSko">LeoSko</a> who gave me good advice and an opportunity.
    I plan to become a full stack dev one day.
